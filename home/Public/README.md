### 👇 **Wat da quack iz diz?!**

When building and activating the system this directory is symlinked to users home directory,  
it's combined with pre-existing Public directory and if `www` is defined at `config.this.host.modules.services`   
files are copied to wwww and served over webserver in a custom file browser interface.  
If both `www` and `caddy` is defined the file server is served using Caddy as a template,  
if only `www` is defined it's served with `http.server` using Python.
